# merge-up
*Project submission for HackExeter 2022*

A puzzle-platformer where you control 2 blocks that can be merged together through maze-like levels.

## What does this have to do with "Unity"
Our game is centered around the use of merging different blocks to advance through different puzzles. In a way, our core game mechanic is "unity". We wanted to create a game about bringing things together as one in order persevere through different challenges, and we feel like this concept achieves this in a way that we thought would stand out.

## How does it work?
The project is written entirely in python, and uses the pygame library for graphics and game development.

We created our own framework from scratch so that we could efficiently add each game object in a clean and simple fashion.

The usage of interfaces and superclasses gives the game a solid base to be developed on, and allows how easy scaling.

## Challenges that we faced
Time management. Deadlines are bully :[

This is the first hackathon for all of us. Our idea was cool, but unfortunatly too ambitious. If we were to compete next year, we would focus much more on how we would budget our time.

## Setup And Running MergeUp
Requires an installation of python v3.8.x or greater to run.

Once you have that installed, simply run the main.py file from a command prompt or an IDE.
